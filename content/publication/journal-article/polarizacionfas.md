abstract: "This study examines the variation in the perception of support for the Armed Forces (FAS) across different autonomous communities, considering political ideologies and territorial identities. Employing data from CIS surveys (2015, 2017) on National Defence and the Armed Forces, as well as Sociométrica surveys on defence culture (2018-2021), the study reveals that, despite an overall positive evaluation of the FAS, significant regional variations exist. National identities emerge as a crucial factor, beyond ideological positions, influencing individuals’ attitudes toward the military institution. This suggests that the FAS is perceived not only as an administrative entity but also as a political symbol with deeper meanings. Political polarization is evident, with voters from independence-leaning and far-left parties expressing strong opposition to the FAS. Conversely, supporters of national parties exhibit more positive views, while the far-right displays radicalized perspectives. The study suggests the need for inclusive defence policies that promote a broader understanding of the purpose of the FAS, aligning with the diversity of Spanish society."
