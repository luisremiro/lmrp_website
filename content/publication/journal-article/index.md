abstract: "Convergence between society and the armed forces is a crucial factor in civil-military relations. For decades, Spanish governments have expressed regret at the deficient political culture of defence among Spaniards low knowledge of or disinterest in defence and strong disaffection towards it and the armed forces. The solution has been to increase knowledge and social identification with the armed forces, as this would increase support for military and defence policies.
This paper shows that the political culture of defence is not a single construct, nor is it accurate to link knowledge and support. Defence political culture is composed of different attitudes that, depending on how they interrelate, give rise to different subcultures. This theoretical study explains how there are at least five sub-types of political advocacy culture (uncritical endorsement, critical endorsement, indifference, critical rejection, and uncritical rejection). These are defined and operationalised based on CIS and Sociometrica questionnaires and the 'REPENFAS21' project of the Spanish Research Agency."
