I am a Postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Political Science at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF). My undergraduate studies are in Political Science and Administration with a specialization in International Relations at the Universidad Central de Venezuela. My main research interests are political behavior and quantitative research methods. Specifically, I focus on affective polarization and voters' attitudes towards institutions. 

I defended my dissertation, entitled [*Patterns of individual and elite affective polarisation in Latin America*](https://www.tdx.cat/handle/10803/691045), at the Universitat de Barcelona in 2024. My dissertation focused on the factors driving affective polarization in Latin America, specifically examining elite behavior, the role of leaders in shaping political identities, and how democratic backsliding can drive affective polarization.
